(INBOUND, EXTERNAL) : A customer uses Monte Carlo as a tool for data observability. They have set it up so that Monte Carlo catches any table health or data reliability issues early on. The customer would like Atlan to also become a near-real-time repository of such issues, with relevant metadata attached to respective assets.
---------------------------------------------------------------
What can do Monte Carlo?
- Freshness seeks to understand how up-to-date your data tables are, as well as the cadence at which your tables are updated. Freshness is particularly important when it comes to decision making; after all, stale data is basically synonymous with wasted time and money.
- Monitoring data volume can help identify missing data, duplicate data and other issues. If 200 million rows suddenly turns into 5 million, you should know.
- Is your data in an acceptable range? Quality gives you visibility into null values, duplicate data, and other specific issues based on what you should expect from your data.
- Were any changes made to the organization of your data? Monitoring who makes changes to these tables and when is foundational to understanding the health of your data ecosystem.
- When data breaks, the first question is always “where?” Data lineage provides the answer by telling you which downstream assets were impacted, which upstream sources are contributing to the issue and which colleagues need to be looped in.

- Monte Carlo connects to your existing data stack in minutes, monitoring and alerting to freshness, volume, and schema changes out-of-the-box.
- Monte Carlo equips data teams with rich context about data incidents, including end-to-end field-level lineage for rapid triaging, trouble-shooting, impact analysis, and resolution.
- Monte Carlo generates insights to help you understand what data matters most to your business, where you can cut costs, and how data quality has improved over time.

(OUTBOUND, INTERNAL) : There are internal enrichment automation requirements towards metadata into Atlan, such that any change in the Atlan entity triggers similar changes to entities connected downstream in lineage from that entity.
